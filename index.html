                    <p>My name is Nicole Roberts and I was born in El Centro, California in May of the year
                        1994.
                        I was born to
                        a Mexican father and a half German/half Norweigan mother.</p>
                    <p>I grew up in a town called Mexicali in Baja California, Mexico. My first language was
                        Spanish, however, I
                        quickly learned English and grew up speaking both languages at home.</p>
                    <p>When I was 17 I wanted to transfer to a school in the United States so that I would be
                        able to go to Med
                        School in the states. I moved to Seattle in 2013 to pursue a degree in Marine &
                        Conservational Biology.
                    </p>
                    <p>In June of 2018 I quit my job and bought a one way ticket to Europe, never planning on
                        coming back. I
                        travelled to 11 countries and stayed a total of 4 months abroad. I came back in October
                        of the same year
                        and started working at Zulily as an Assistant Buyer.</p>
                    <p>I am now pursuing further education in Software Engineering to be able to one day create
                        software that
                        will program buildings to be 100% self sustainable.</p>
